# CSE 8803 ASI — HW2: Influence Maximization  
**Public Autograder Tests | Spring 2026**

Hey! 👋  
This repository contains the **public autograder tests** for **Homework 2** of **CSE 8803: AI for Social Impact (ASI)**.

HW2 will teach us modeling and optimizing for Influence Maximization. The goal of this assignment is to get familiar with real-world Social Impact applications while familiarising yourself with influence spread and influence maximization concepts.

## 📓 Starter Notebook (Google Colab)

We recommend using Colab to avoid local setup issues.

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn

By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:

- Model Influence Spread through network diffusion (Linear Threshold Model and Independent Cascade Model)
- Approximately solve the Influence Maximization problem using Linear Programming, and Greedy Algorithms
- Apply these ideas to a real-world contact network to model flu spread in a school, and disease spread in a hospital.

These are core tools used in any influence maximization scenario, and broader AI-for-social-good problems.

## 🧪 About the Tests (Important!)

- This repo contains **public tests only** — they’re here so you can sanity-check your implementation.
- The **official grading** happens on Gradescope.
- Please **do not modify the test files**. If your code passes the public tests but fails Gradescope, it usually means a small edge case is missing.

## 📝 Gradescope Submission Checklist

You’ll submit **two things**:

### ✅ 1. Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) — *Autograded* (/85)
- Complete **all `TODO:` blocks** in the notebook.
- Submit the notebook to the **HW2** assignment on Gradescope.
- Gradescope will run your code from scratch, so make sure it runs top-to-bottom.

### 📄 2. PDF of the Notebook — *Manually graded* (/15)
- Export or print the completed notebook as a **PDF**.
- Submit it to **HW2 – PDF** on Gradescope.
- This is where we grade the **theory questions**.
- Please make sure your answers are readable and not cut off.
- Also it would be super helpful if you could assign the pages on Gradescopes to the questions so that grading will be slightly easier for me! 🙏

## 🤝 Collaboration & Academic Integrity

- Discussing **high-level ideas and approaches** with classmates is encouraged.
- You may consult external resources (including LLMs) for understanding concepts and strengthening mental models

*BUT*

- Your final submission **must be your own work**
- Any collaboration or external resources **must be cited** in the final section of the notebook

We’re chill, not careless — be honest and you’ll be totally fine.
